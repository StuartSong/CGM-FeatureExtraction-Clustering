# CGM-FeatureExtraction-Clustering
Code for analyzing Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data using day segmentation, feature extraction, and clustering methods like UMAP. This project focuses on identifying glycemic patterns to support personalized diabetes management for diabete patients

# **Riemannian Manifold-based Geometric Clustering of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data**

This repository contains the code and data for the study titled **"Riemannian Manifold-based Geometric Clustering of Continuous Glucose Monitoring to Improve Personalized Diabetes Management"**. The project applies advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Riemannian manifold-based geometric clustering, to better understand glycemic control in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and healthy controls using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data. The approach aims to enhance personalized diabetes management.

## **Overview**

This study applies **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)** to CGM data to perform clustering analysis, helping distinguish between individuals with T1D and healthy controls (HC). Through the extraction of glycemic features and dimensionality reduction, we explore the differences in glycemic profiles and propose new insights for personalized diabetes care.

### **Key Highlights**
- **UMAP Clustering**: Utilizes UMAP for effective visualization and separation of glycemic profiles.
- **Silhouette Score Analysis**: Quantifies the differences between T1D and HC clusters using Silhouette Scores.
- **Personalized Care**: Provides interpretable metrics to support more personalized diabetes management.
